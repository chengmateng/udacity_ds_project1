# udacity_ds_project1
project 1 for data science course in udacity

## Introduction

This project uses datasets at stackoverflow.com in 2022.

## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

This is a project for myself to practice what I learn from data science course in Udacity.

For this project, I am interested in using Stack Overflow data in 2022 to better understand:
1. How does the type of remote work arrangement (fully remote, hybrid, in-office) affect developer productivity and job satisfaction?
2. What is the correlation between developersâ€™ education levels and their career progression and compensation?
3. How do different job roles and levels of experience influence the annual compensation of developers?

## File Descriptions

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
