# udacity_ds_project1
project 1 for data science course in udacity

## Introduction

This project uses datasets at stackoverflow.com from 2017-2023.

## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

This is a project for myself to practice what I learn from data science course in Udacity.

For this project, I am interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to 2023 to better understand:
1. What's the trend in areas of high-income people in these years?
2. What trends in remote work preferences and practices can be identified in these years?
3. What trends exist between salary levels, job roles, and job satisfaction?

## File Descriptions

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional .py file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().
